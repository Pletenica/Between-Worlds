# Plataform_Game
##Between Worlds

This project was started as an assigment for the Development of Videogames, subject at CITM, UPC Terrassa. Created by two students in the second year of the Videogames Design and Development career. 
The idea was to create this mini game where yo must adapt in diferents dimensions to surpass diferents obstacles that you will find in your way home. 
This two levels are a small example of four differents dimensions where each of them has diferents mechanics. 

### Controls
-W for jump, double jump, climb and swim downwards.

-A for left direction(backward).

-D for right direction(forward).

-S for swim deeper and climb downwards.

Special debug keys:

-F1/F2 Start from the first/second level

-F3 Start from the beginning of the current level

-F5 Save the current state 

-F6 Load the previous state (even across levels)

-F9 To view colliders / logic 

-F10 God Mode (fly around, cannot be killed)
