## Sinopsis

This project was started as an assigment for the Development of Videogames, subject at CITM, UPC Terrassa. Created by two students in the second year of the Videogames Design and Development career. The idea was to create this mini game where yo must adapt in diferents dimensions to surpass diferents obstacles that you will find in your way home. This two levels are a small example of four differents dimensions where each of them has diferents mechanics.

## How to play

The objective is to arrive at the last portal in the level without dying, you have to known that every portal that you take will change the world and how it interacts with you, the enemies, the envoirment and the mechanics will be different. So if you want to surpass the challenge you will have to adapt at each world fast and have the main controls clear.

First of all you can start the game or enter in a sarted game, change the settings and others options in the menu. Once you start the game know that:

### Basic controls:
-W for jump, double jump, climb and swim downwards.

-A for left direction(backward).

-D for right direction(forward).

-S for swim deeper and climb downwards.

### Special debug keys:
-F1/F2 Start from the first/second level

-F3 Start from the beginning of the current level

-F5 Save the current state 

-F6 Load the previous state (even across levels)

-F9 To view colliders / logic 

-F10 God Mode (fly around, cannot be killed)

-F11 Cap FPS (Cap to 30 fps or not)
